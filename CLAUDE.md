# cubefarm

A cartoon first-person 3D office (React Three Fiber) over a Node orchestrator that runs one Claude Code session
(Claude Agent SDK) per developer, QA tester and the CEO, each in its own git worktree, working through GitHub issues.
This is the app the company runs on: a live office is running from this repo right now. README.md is the quick start; docs/how-it-works.md and CONTRIBUTING.md have the details.
It ships on npm as `cubefarm` (`npx cubefarm`); it used to be called Office Swarm.

## SAFETY (read first)

- The live office runs from `C:\Projects\office-swarm` on this machine, on ports 4317 (server) and 5317 (Vite),
  with its state in `~/.cubefarm`. Never edit or run anything there, never read or write `~/.cubefarm` directly, and
  never use ports 4317 or 5317.
- Test only in demo mode (fake GitHub, fake agents, no Claude usage), with an isolated `SWARM_HOME` and your reserved
  `SWARM_PORT` (from your job instructions):

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  SWARM_HOME="$PWD/.swarm-home" SWARM_PORT=<your port> node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo
  ```
  ```powershell
  npm install; npm run build
  $env:SWARM_HOME="$PWD\.swarm-home"; $env:SWARM_PORT="<your port>"; node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo
  ```
  Then open `http://localhost:<your port>` (the server serves the built `dist/`). The startup banner must say
  `DEMO MODE` and print a `state:` path inside your `SWARM_HOME`. Stop it when done; don't commit `.swarm-home`.
- Never real mode (no `--demo`), and never `npm run dev` / `npm run demo` / `npm start` / `npx cubefarm`: they default
  to 4317, and `dev`/`demo` default Vite to 5317. The first three run `scripts/office.mjs`, the launcher, which also
  updates its own folder (git fetch + merge, npm install, build) when the office or you ask for it (`u`). Run it
  only in a throwaway clone outside the live office, with `--demo` and your `SWARM_HOME`, `SWARM_PORT` and
  `SWARM_CLIENT_PORT`.
- Agents are ordinary coding-agent CLI sessions on the manager's own setup, unsandboxed, by the manager's choice. The
  office's workflow rules (no pushes to the default branch, no merging, QA leaves GitHub alone) live in their prompts
  and instructions, not in enforcement: don't add hooks, permission rules or sandboxes that refuse tool calls.
  `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CLAUDE_*` are stripped from agent and preview env.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` over client, server, shared, the `.ts` in scripts and the configs |
| `npm test` | Vitest, once (`npm run test:watch` to re-run on edits) |
| `npm run build` | typecheck, `vite build` to `dist/`, then the server bundled into `dist-server/` (`scripts/build-server.mjs`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | optional, local only: Playwright (`e2e/`, `playwright.config.ts`): builds (`E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` reuses your `dist/`), boots a demo office on `E2E_PORT` (default 4399; set it to your reserved port) with a temp `SWARM_HOME`, and smoke-tests it headless in a local Google Chrome, else Playwright's Chromium. Stops at once if the browser is missing: never install it mid-task |
| `node scripts/smoke-package.mjs` | after a build: packs the npm package, installs it into a temp folder and boots its demo |
| `npm run bench -- --port <yours>` | after a build: the scale benchmark (`scripts/bench.mjs`): boots the big-company demo headless, visits the lobby and three floors, writes FPS, frame-time p95, CPU per frame, draw calls, triangles, heap, audio nodes and websocket traffic to a JSON report (`--help`) |
| `node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo` | a demo office (see SAFETY for the env it needs) |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Node 24, `npm ci` → `typecheck` → `test` → `build` → package smoke test, for every PR
and push to `main`, with a throwaway `SWARM_HOME` and `SWARM_PORT=0`, on `ubuntu-latest` always and on `windows-latest`
and `macos-latest` unless a PR touches nothing OS-sensitive (only `client/`, `e2e/`, docs: they show as skipped).
e2e is not part of CI. Locally, `typecheck`, `test` and `build` must pass before you open a PR. Don't run `test:e2e`
unless an issue asks for it. If your change shows up in the office, boot your own demo office, check it in a real
browser with the Playwright tools, and put screenshots in the PR. `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes to npm when the manager runs it from GitHub's Actions tab or pushes a
`v*` tag (npm trusted publishing, tied to that file name); never publish or tag releases yourself.

## Code map

Server (`server/`, Node + Express 5 + ws, run by tsx in development; esbuild bundles it into `dist-server/` for npm):
- `index.ts`: entry; picks the real or demo backend, REST routes under `/api`, the `/ws` and `/ws/term` websockets, serves `dist/`, shutdown.
- `config.ts`: `SWARM_PORT` (default 4317), `SWARM_HOME` (default `~/.cubefarm`), `--demo`, state file, intervals,
  the default projects folder.
- `swarm.ts`: the orchestrator. Floors, agents, scheduling/auto-assign, dev → QA → fix → merge loop, dev and QA
  prompts, CEO job queue, phone messages, persistence (`state.json` / `demo-state.json`), websocket fan-out (through
  `outbox.ts`).
- `outbox.ts`: what goes out on `/ws`: agents' and floors' changes batched on a 250 ms tick as patches of what
  changed, terminal lines only to the tabs that show them (`shared/watch.ts`), catch-ups when a tab's watch changes.
- `agentRunner.ts`: one Agent SDK session; options, env stripping, Playwright MCP, and turning the SDK stream into
  terminal lines.
- `cliRunner.ts`: the terminal runtime (the default): one agent as the real CLI in a node-pty, same session contract
  as `agentRunner.ts`. Claude Code reports through HTTP hooks (`POST /api/hooks/:token`; PreToolUse approves every
  call); Codex reports turn endings (notify) and, once the manager trusts them, its steps (`-c hooks.*`); OpenCode
  only turn endings. Codex/OpenCode screenshots are collected from the session's Playwright output folder. Esc in a
  terminal ends the session as `interrupted`. The CEO's office tools are served over MCP (`/api/mcp/:token`).
- `ptyHost.ts`: the terminal keeper, a detached process of its own (`launch` re-spawns it outside the office's process
  tree) holding the CLIs' pseudo-terminals and relaying their hooks, so agents keep working through office restarts.
  `ptyClient.ts` is the office's side (start/connect, spawn, adopt after a restart, local fallback); `ptyProtocol.ts`
  their JSON-lines messages. The launcher's `office:shutdown` says `restart: false` when quitting: CLIs stop then.
  A developer's CLI stays at its prompt after the task (`keepAlive`): follow-ups and prompts typed there reuse it.
- `clis.ts`: the CLIs (Claude Code from the SDK's bundled binary, Codex, OpenCode): detection, Windows `.cmd` shim
  unwrapping, each one's command line, and the helper scripts they call back with.
- `terminal.ts`: `AgentTerminal`, a headless xterm mirror per agent (replay for late viewers, saved to disk), its
  `/ws/term` viewers, and keystrokes/resizes to the running CLI.
- `ceo.ts`: the CEO's office MCP tools (`createOfficeTools`, zod-validated), `ceoSystemPrompt`, `ceoJobPrompt`.
- `acpRunner.ts`: the CEO on another harness (`settings.ceoHarness`: nano-coder, Copilot) over ACP (`<cli> --acp`),
  same session contract; the office tools as a shell command (`POST /api/office/:token/:tool`). `acp.ts` is its pure part.
- `backend.ts`: the `Backend` interface (everything touching GitHub, git, disk and sessions) and `realBackend`.
- `demo.ts`: `createDemoBackend()`: fake GitHub, fake sessions (drawn into the agent's terminal in the terminal runtime), fake previews for `--demo`;
  `--floors N --agents N` (or `SWARM_DEMO_FLOORS` / `SWARM_DEMO_AGENTS`) makes it a big company for scale tests.
- `github.ts`: all GitHub access through the `gh` CLI.
- `workspace.ts`: floor checkouts, per-agent worktrees (`<SWARM_HOME>/workspaces/<owner>__<repo>/desks/<agent>`),
  fast-forwarding main, per-repo git lock, stopping processes an agent left running.
- `exec.ts`: `run` / `git` / `gh`: `execFile` without a shell, prompts disabled, `CommandError` with stderr.
- `previews.ts`: one preview per floor: ports (6300 + floor), statuses, config validation; and the PR theatre's PR
  previews (`prTheatre.ts`: their slots, ports, eviction and idle stop, pure; `syncProxy.ts`: compare mode's synced scrolling).
- `qaShots.ts`: QA's screenshots of each PR's latest round, kept for the app viewer's QA panel.
- `previewRunner.ts`: checks out, installs and runs a floor's app in its preview worktree; kills the process tree.
- `httpError.ts`: `HttpError(status, message)`.
- `officeUpdate.ts`: the office's self-update: the drain decision, the launcher contract (IPC, `last-update.json`).
- `pacing.ts`: pacing new work after Claude's usage warnings: the start/skip decision and the usage state.
- `presence.ts`: shared presence: relays tabs' poses, emotes and pings on `/ws` to their floor (pure interest and rate
  rules), never saved; `demoVisitors.ts` walks the demo's fake visitors. Names and limits in `shared/presence.ts`.
- `voice.ts`: phone messages read aloud (docs/voice.md): the ElevenLabs key in `secrets.json`, voices, cached clips;
  `elevenlabs.ts` is its REST client. The words spoken come from `shared/speech.ts`. `secrets.ts`: that file's reads and merged writes.
- `notifier.ts`: notifications (docs/pocket.md): the rate-limited fan-out to open tabs (desktop), Web Push and the chat
  apps' webhooks (secrets in `secrets.json`, push keys and devices in `push.json`), behind `Backend.notify`; `notify.ts`
  is its pure part (formatting, the per-event rate limit, webhook checks), `webPush.ts` VAPID and RFC 8291 encryption,
  `shared/notify.ts` the settings. `pwa.ts`: the installable app's service worker, served at `/sw.js`.
- `journal.ts`: the time-lapse journal (`<SWARM_HOME>/journal/<day>/`): records what `Swarm.broadcast` sends, a file
  per 10-minute keyframe, pruning, and the reads behind `/api/journal/*`. The rules (what's kept, secrets, seeking,
  marks) are in `shared/journal.ts`; `journalSample.ts` is the demo's made-up day.

The `cubefarm` command (`bin/cubefarm.js`, plain JS): checks Node/git/gh/Claude login, starts `dist-server/index.js`,
opens the browser; `login` and `doctor` subcommands.

The launcher (`scripts/office.mjs`, plain JS; `npm run dev` / `demo` / `start`): runs the server (plus Vite with
`--dev`, watching `server/` and `shared/`) with `SWARM_LAUNCHER=1` and an IPC channel, and applies office updates:
stop, fast-forward, install/build, restart, roll back on failure, `<SWARM_HOME>/last-update.json`. Its pure decisions
are in `scripts/officeSteps.mjs` (tested in `officeSteps.test.ts`).

Shared (`shared/`, imported by both sides):
- `types.ts`: the REST/websocket contract (`WorldSnapshot`, `ServerEvent`, views, settings).
- `issues.ts`: issue conventions (`swarm:<specialty>` labels, `Depends on #N`, hold-up ranking).
- `journal.ts`: the time-lapse journal's format and pure rules, for the server and the replay.
- `watch.ts`: which terminal lines a tab gets: its floor, open panels, the workers list's latest lines.
- `looks.ts`: the look editor's options and `cleanStyle` (an agent's `style`, checked on the server).

Client (`client/`, Vite root; React 19, R3F, drei, zustand):
- `src/world/`: the 3D building: floors, desks, characters (`appearance.ts`, `characterParts.ts`, `Figure.tsx`, `face.ts`), elevator,
  whiteboard, player movement and collisions (`layout.ts`), canvas textures (`draw.ts`), `toys/` (Rapier physics),
  where people can walk (`walkways.ts`: the walk grid, paths, named spots and steering, on the roomba's grid),
  errands that get them up (`errands.ts`: the registry and who may go; `ErrandDirector.tsx` runs them), toy
  errands (`toyErrands.ts`: hoops and catch, on `toys/npc.ts`, the toys' hands for people, aimed by `toys/npcAim.ts`),
  comings and goings (`socials.ts`: hires by elevator, leavers with a box, chats, visits, the CEO's stroll),
  the time of day (`sky/time.ts`, `sky/useDayTime.ts`) and the city outside (`outside/`: the seeded layout in
  `cityLayout.ts`, drawn by `City.tsx` in six instanced draw calls), the camera's other views (`camera/`: the
  overview, the building view and the follow cam in `rig.ts`, pose maths in `cameraMath.ts`, the cutaway as global
  clipping planes), the gamepad (`gamepad.ts`) and the graphics tiers (`gfx/`: Low/Medium/High/Auto in `quality.ts`
  with Auto's governor, post-processing in a lazy chunk (`Effects.tsx`, `pipeline.ts`); a material blooms only if
  `bloomMarks.ts` marks it), the other people viewing the office (`presence/`: visitors, pings, the profile),
  holiday themes (`themes/`: which one is on from `shared/themes.ts`, their data and decoration slots in `themes.ts`
  and `layout.ts`, each theme's scene in one lazy chunk loaded only while a theme is on; `?theme=` and `?date=` for QA).
- `src/ui/`: HTML overlays: HUD, terminal (`LiveTerminal.tsx`: xterm.js on `/ws/term`), Kanban, manager's console,
  phone (with its mini-games in `games/`: pure logic in `tetris.ts` / `snake.ts` / `pet.ts`), elevator panel, app
  viewer, sounds (`sfx.ts`), key bindings (`keymap.ts`, pure; `controls.ts` keeps the player's own, and every
  shortcut asks it, never a hard-coded key).
- Accessibility (Settings → Accessibility, `ui/a11y.ts`, saved per browser through pure `a11yPrefs.ts`): captions
  (`captions.ts`, rules in `captionRules.ts`; every sound `sfx.ts` records is offered to them), status colours and
  shapes (`statusLook.ts`, shared by CSS and the canvases), motion comfort (call `reduceMotion()` before animating
  the camera or anything non-essential), UI scale, readable font, high contrast. Dialogs use `dialogFocus.ts`
  (focus in, trapped, returned); `announce()` speaks to screen readers; `FloorList.tsx` is the list view.
- `src/pocket/`: pocket mode (docs/pocket.md), the 2D office for phones (`mode.ts` picks it; `App.tsx` loads it or the
  3D `Office.tsx` lazily, so a phone never downloads three.js). `src/pwa.ts` registers the service worker and Web Push;
  `src/notifications.ts` shows desktop notifications. `ui/Panel.tsx` is the panel, apart from `Overlays.tsx` (3D).
- `src/photo/`: photo mode and clips, lazy-loaded except `gate.ts` (on/frozen, the K and I keys, `__swarmPhoto`):
  `PhotoScene.tsx` (its own camera; frozen, the frame loop stops and it draws on change), `post.ts` (filters and depth
  of field on the finished picture), `recorder.ts` / `instantReplay.ts` (MediaRecorder; `webmRing.ts` keeps the last 15 s),
  `PhotoPanel.tsx`, and pure `flight.ts`, `shots.ts`, `filters.ts`.
- `src/store.ts`: the zustand store; `apply(ServerEvent)` folds websocket events into UI state.
- `src/api.ts`: REST calls; errors become toasts.
- `src/net.ts`: the websocket connection with reconnect; it sends the tab's watch (`src/watch.ts`) as it changes.
  `src/perf.tsx`: render pausing, adaptive DPR, `?stats` (and `window.__swarmStats` with a census of what's drawn).
- `src/world/batch.ts` / `Batched.tsx`: a floor's repeated parts (Toon.tsx's boxes, people's `Piece`s) drawn as
  instanced batches behind invisible stand-ins (`?batch=off` to compare). `src/world/paint/`: canvas textures
  recorded here and painted in an OffscreenCanvas worker, with the canvas path as fallback (`?paint=main`).
- `src/replay.ts`: the time-lapse: plays the journal through `store.apply(ev, 'play' | 'seek')` while live events
  wait; `replayClock.ts` is its pure clock and "since I was last here", `ui/TimeLapse.tsx` its console tab and bar.

## Conventions

- ESM TypeScript everywhere (`"type": "module"`), strict, `noUnusedLocals`/`Parameters`. The server runs through
  tsx and imports with `.ts` extensions (`import { run } from './exec.ts'`); client files import without extensions.
- Comments are sparse and say why: a short header comment per file describing its role, `/** */` on exported
  functions and interface fields when the name isn't enough, inline notes for Windows or safety reasons, and
  `// ---------- section ----------` dividers in long files. No commented-out code.
- Demo parity: every new `Backend` method, CEO tool or capability gets a fake in `server/demo.ts`, so `--demo` works
  with no GitHub, no git/npm and no Claude usage.
- UI state comes from the server: on connect the client gets a `snapshot`, then typed `ServerEvent`s (`repo`,
  `agent`, `qa`, `ceo`, `message`, `toast`, …) from `Swarm.broadcast`; agents' and floors' frequent changes come
  batched as `agents` / `repos` patches and terminal lines as `logs` / `latest`, only for what the tab shows
  (`server/outbox.ts`). Add new state to `shared/types.ts`, the snapshot and an event, and handle it in `store.ts`'s
  `apply`. REST is for commands, not for polling state. A big company must fit `server/scale.test.ts`'s budgets.
- REST errors: throw `HttpError(4xx, message)`; the handler in `index.ts` returns `{ error }` JSON, anything else
  is a logged 500. Validate request bodies by hand at the route or in the swarm.
- CEO tools: zod input schemas, errors worded so the CEO can act on them, small outputs.
- Windows first (the office runs on Windows):
  - build paths with `path.join` / `path.resolve`; paths may contain spaces, so pass args as arrays (`execFile`),
    never string-built shell commands;
  - `fs.rm` with `maxRetries` for EBUSY/EPERM file locks; write state to a temp file and `rename`;
  - kill process trees, not just the child (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, process groups elsewhere);
  - `windowsHide: true` on spawns; npm on Windows goes through `cmd.exe`.
- Agent prompts are paid for on every session: keep prompt text short and specific.

## Tests

- Vitest, `*.test.ts` next to the code, anywhere under `client/`, `server/`, `shared/` or `scripts/`
  (e.g. `shared/issues.test.ts`, `client/src/world/layout.test.ts`, `server/ceo.test.ts`). Config: `vitest.config.ts`.
- Test pure functions directly; extract logic into pure helpers rather than mocking. No network, no `gh`, no Claude
  sessions, no real `~/.cubefarm`: `npm test` already points `SWARM_HOME` at a temp folder and `SWARM_PORT` at 0.
- Must pass on both CI runners (ubuntu + windows): don't hardcode `/` or `\` in expected paths.
- E2E: one spec file per feature, setup from `e2e/helpers.ts`; new e2e tests go in their feature's spec file or a new one, never appended to `smoke.spec.ts`.

## Pull requests

- One issue per PR, `Closes #<n>` in the body. Keep the diff small and on-topic.
- Many PRs merge in parallel and auto-merge sends conflicts back: don't reformat, reorder or rename code you aren't
  changing, and don't touch unrelated files.
- Before opening it: `typecheck`, `test` and `build`. `test:e2e` only when an issue asks for it; CI doesn't run it.
- Say how you verified it and list your assumptions. UI changes get screenshots from the demo office.
- Never push to `main`, never force-push, never merge your own PR.
